# How to run app:

In each directory (backend and then frontend), run:

### `npm install` 
-> run this only once at first app run, to create the node_modules package containing the dependencies

### then run `npm start`

ps: the frontend is reloaded at each Ctrl + S, so you don't have to re-run npm start for each change in the ui
